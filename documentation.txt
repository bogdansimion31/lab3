Data Structures used:
PIF:
    I used a python list as a table containing pairs of 2 : position and the respective value according to the
    codification ( reserved word, constant etc. )

ST:
    I used the same symbol table for constants and identifiers. My symbol table is modeled as an unsorted table
    using python's built in dictionary. Each pair consists of the value and its position in the table.

Regex Explication:
    -identifier regex r'^[a-zA-Z]([a-zA-Z]|[0-9]){,7}$' : must begin with either upper/lowercase letter,
     then capture any upper/lowercase letter or digit
    -constant regex (integer) ^(0|[\+\-]?[1-9][0-9]*)$ : we either have 0 or an integer represented
    signed or unsigned as a sequence of digits starting with a digit different from 0
    -constant regex (char sequence) ^[A-Za-z\s]*$ : any number of upper/lowercase characters or whitespaces
